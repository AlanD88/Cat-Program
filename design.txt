Using the main function arguments argc and argv[], check for the number of arguments given in the command line when running the program.  If argc is only 1, so that no argument other than the program name are given, run the program through a while loop, reading the standard input and outputting it back and continue to do this till the function read() returns 0 or negative integer value.
Else if argc is greater than 1, run through each argument past the first and open them using the function open() and check to see if the file exists.  If it does not, print an error and exit. If the files do exist, read the contents of the file using function read() and write the contents using function write() to stdout.  Continue doing this for every filename given until one is encountered that does not exist.  If this occurs, exit the program with an error using perror() function.
